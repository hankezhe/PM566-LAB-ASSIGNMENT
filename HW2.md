### Download and Read in the data

First download and then read in with data.table:fread()

``` r
# download individual/regional data from github
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/01_chs/chs_individual.csv", "chs_individual.csv", method="libcurl", timeout = 60)
individual <- data.table::fread("chs_individual.csv")

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/01_chs/chs_regional.csv", "chs_regional.csv", method="libcurl", timeout = 60)
regional <- data.table::fread("chs_regional.csv")

library(data.table)
```

    ## Warning: package 'data.table' was built under R version 4.0.2

``` r
library(dtplyr)
```

    ## Warning: package 'dtplyr' was built under R version 4.0.2

``` r
library(dplyr)
```

There are 1200 raws and 23 coloumns in the individual dataset; 12 raws
and 27 variables in the regional dataset. \#\#\# Merge

``` r
## merge the two dataset by location
ind_region <- merge(x = individual, y = regional, by.x = "townname", by.y = "townname", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE) 

count_n <- merge(x = individual, y = regional, by.x = "townname", by.y = "townname", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE) %>%nrow()
```

The \# of the merged dataset is the same as that of the individual
dataset - no duplicates.

### Manipulate the data

``` r
# check the missing values for bmi
message("Missing: ", ind_region[is.na(bmi), .N])
```

    ## Missing: 89

``` r
# impute data using the average within the variables “male” and “hispanic"
ind_region[, bmi_imp := fcoalesce(bmi, mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)),
    by = .(male, hispanic)]
ind_region$bmi[is.na(ind_region$bmi)] <- ind_region$bmi_imp
```

    ## Warning in ind_region$bmi[is.na(ind_region$bmi)] <- ind_region$bmi_imp: number
    ## of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length

``` r
# check the missing values for fev

    ## Missing: 95

ind_region$fev[is.na(ind_region$fev)] <- ind_region$fev_imp
```

    ## Warning in ind_region$fev[is.na(ind_region$fev)] <- ind_region$fev_imp: number
    ## of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length

``` r
# Create a new categorical variable named “obesity_level” using the BMI measurement (underweight BMI<14; normal BMI 14-22; overweight BMI 22-24; obese BMI>24). 
ind_region$obesity_level <- ifelse(ind_region$bmi>= 14 & ind_region$bmi<= 22, "normal", 
                         ifelse(ind_region$bmi<14, "underweight",

```

    ## Missing: 40

    ## Missing: 33

``` r

ind_region$smoke_gas_exposure <- ifelse(ind_region$smoke== 1 & ind_region$gasstove == 1, "exposed to both", 
                         ifelse(ind_region$smoke==1 & ind_region$gasstove != 1, "exposed to smoke",
                        ifelse(ind_region$smoke !=1 & ind_region$gasstove == 1, "exposed to gas stove", "not exposed to both")))

### 4\. Exploratory Data Analysis

  - 1.  What is the association between BMI and FEV (forced expiratory
        volume)?

  - 2.  What is the association between smoke and gas exposure and FEV?

  - 3.  What is the association between PM2.5 exposure and
FEV?
